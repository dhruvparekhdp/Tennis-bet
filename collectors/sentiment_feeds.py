"""
Free, keyless sentiment inputs, and how they move a signal's confidence.

Two feeds earn their place because both are free, need no API key, and both
measure something the price-derived indicators cannot see:

  Fear & Greed Index (alternative.me) — a 0-100 crowd-positioning gauge,
  updated daily. Extremes matter far more than the middle: 15 and 85 say
  something, 48 and 52 say nothing.

  Funding rate (the exchange itself) — what longs are paying shorts right now.
  Heavily positive funding means the crowd is crowded long and paying for the
  privilege, which is the condition that precedes a flush.

Design decision worth stating: neither of these fires a signal of its own.
They adjust the confidence of a signal that already exists, and confidence
sets position size. A sentiment reading is a reason to size up or down, not a
reason to trade — treating it as an entry trigger is how a daily-resolution
number ends up driving a thirty-minute decision.
